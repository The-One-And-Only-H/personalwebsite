<h3>Python</h3>

<p>After I'd spent several months studying front-end development, I began my exploration of backend coding and discovered Python. This was partially thanks to reading Allen B. Downey’s “How to Think Like a Computer Scientist”. This language quickly developed a special place in my heart, largely owing to it's clean and concise syntax. So after teaching myself the fundamentals, I decided I wanted to teach myself by building a project.</p>

<h3>TREP</h3>

<p>I decided to choose a subject that is close to my heart and so The Rainbow Encyclopedia Project (TREP) was born. I wanted to showcase the many prominent figures throughout LGBT history in such a way that is engaging and user friendly. Initially I developed the front-end code, starting with design, layout and functionality, using a mix of the skills I'd learned with HTML, CSS, and some jQuery. The generation of the actual site was done using Python scripting to compose the final output. I then manually pushed the static HTML to GitHub for deployment, which you can see here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/TREP</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>Having experimented with some jQuery, I decided to take a few steps back. I wanted to utilise the foundations of my understanding of JavaScript. Since then, I have begun constructing a professional website for a friend, only this time I really wanted to challenge myself. So I set myself the goal of creating an entire website with minimal HTML whilst making the most of raw JS. You can check out this project here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/jasminewebsite</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>Having attended several job interviews already, one problem I have continually experienced is my lack of professional experience of using code in the work place. As a self-taught developer, this has been my main hurdle to overcome in securing myself a job in the tech industry. I have therefore been tackling my current job from the perspective of a developer and have since managed to find myself a task where I can use my knowledge of programming to everyone's benefit. In short, a large database in the form of an Excel spreadsheet needed reorganising and so, rather than attempting to solve this manually, I wrote a Python script instead, which you can see here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/spreadsheetorganisation</p>
