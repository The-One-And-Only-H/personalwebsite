<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>Hello! My name is H and I am a self-taught developer. I currently work full-time for a homelessness charity in Brighton and have been working in the third sector in both paid and voluntary roles for the past ten years. I see myself as an ambitious and driven character who enjoys a good challenge. Coding has scratched my problem solving itch and now I want to do it as more than just a hobby.</p>

<h3>How have I taught myself?</h3>

<h3>Codebar</h3>

<p>After expressing an interest in career change to a friend of mine last year, they suggested attending Codebar to see if computer programming might be of interest. I completed their HTML tutorial during my first visit and I was hooked. I began exploring online resources so as to expand my coding knowledge and soon moved onto learning CSS and JavaScript with Codecademy whilst watching video tutorials on Pluralsight. Given I currently work full-time, I spent every evening in the local library, dedicating my free time to code.</p>

<h3>What I want to do next?</h3>

<p>I want to improve upon my knowledge of JavaScript with a view to eventually familiarising myself with the React library. I also have an interest in exploring Node.js owing to my interest in back-end code. Going on from this, I would like to develop my skills in Python, which I would like to start using for web applications. Because of this, I would similarly like to explore Django with a view to building an updatable and dynamic version of my project TREP. While I have an interest in back-end development, I am also keen to expand my understanding of JavaScript and other front-end technologies.</p>

<h3>Code Brunch</h3>

<p>Additionally, I have recently set up a new group in Brighton entitled Code Brunch, which endeavours to be a regular coding event for women, trans people and non-binary folk to help each other work on their own projects in a safe and supportive space. The first public event took place in the last week of July and has successfully been going every month since.</p>
